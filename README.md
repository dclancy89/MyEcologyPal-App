# Welcome MyEcologyPal ðŸ‘‹

This is POC (Proof of Concept) Android App for ecological and environmental data collection.

This app is not intended to be used as a production ready app, nor is it intended to be used for live field data where data integrity is needed.

## My Ecology Pal

When groups need to collect data in the field for any number of reasons, whether it be water samples, soil sample, or even just damage to a known path or structure, sometimes you need a tool to be able to quickly and accurately record as much data as you can in a way that can unlock easy analytics and discovery.

My Ecology Pal allows team (or a single person) to be able to quickly and accurately collect field data that can be uploaded to a central server for later analytics.

### Key Features

- Offline mode for storing data locally on the mobile device when you're away from cellular or wifi connectivity

- Multiple template types for data collection that automatically capture GPS coordinates, Date, and Time.

- Ability to bulk upload all data that was collected offline in one mass upload.

- Can be side loaded onto inexpensive Android tablets to keep costs low for low fund teams.
